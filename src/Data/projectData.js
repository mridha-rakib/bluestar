  Bluestar now offers custom DADU (Detached Accessory Dwelling Unit) as a

  both creative and technical, balancing regulations, aesthetics, and function.
  Here’s the step-by-step design process:
</p>

<ol class="text-left pt-5">
  <li class="pb-5">
    <strong class="leading-9">1.Site &amp; Zoning Analysis</strong>
    <ul>
      <li className="text-left leading-9">Research local codes: Check city zoning rules, lot size requirements, height limits, setbacks, parking requirements, and maximum square footage.</li>
      <li class="leading-9">Site conditions: Measure the lot, identify utilities (water, sewer, power), and note features like slope, trees, or easements.</li>
      <li class="leading-9">Placement options: Decide where the DADU fits best—often at the rear or side of the lot for privacy.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li class="pb-5">
    <strong>2.Needs &amp; Goals Assessment</strong>
    <ul>
      <li class="leading-9">Purpose: Rental income, multigenerational living, guest space, office, or future downsizing?</li>
      <li class="leading-9">Occupants: Singles, couples, or families—this informs bedroom count, accessibility, and storage.</li>
      <li class="leading-9">Budget: Establish a realistic range, factoring in construction, permits, and site work.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li class="pb-5">
    <strong>3.Conceptual Design</strong>
    <ul>
      <li class="leading-9">Size &amp; layout: Maximize efficiency with an open plan, vertical space, and built-ins.</li>
      <li class="leading-9">Style: Match or complement the primary home’s architecture, or choose a contrasting modern design.</li>
      <li class="leading-9">Privacy: Place windows, entries, and outdoor areas to reduce sightlines between the main house and DADU.</li>
      <li class="leading-9">Outdoor connection: Patios, decks, or shared gardens improve livability.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li class="pb-5">
    <strong>4.Schematic Design</strong>
    <ul>
      <li class="leading-9">Floor plans: Sketch multiple options for living, kitchen, bath, and bedroom placement.</li>
      <li class="leading-9">Mass &amp; form: Develop 3D studies or models to understand rooflines, scale, and shadows.</li>
      <li class="leading-9">Sustainability: Integrate energy-efficient systems, natural lighting, and good insulation early.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li class="pb-5">
    <strong>5.Design Development</strong>
    <ul>
      <li class="leading-9">Detailed drawings: Refine kitchen, bath, storage, and circulation.<br></li>
      <li class="leading-9">Material selection: Choose siding, roofing, windows, and finishes within budget.</li>
      <li class="leading-9">Systems planning: HVAC, plumbing, and electrical systems.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li class="pb-5">
    <strong>6.Permitting &amp; Approvals</strong>
    <ul>
      <li class="leading-9">Submit plans: Work with an architect, designer, or engineer to prepare permit drawings.</li>
      <li class="leading-9">City review: Address zoning, building codes, energy requirements, and any neighborhood covenants.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li class="pb-5">
    <strong>7.Construction Documentation</strong>
  </li>

  <li class="pb-5">
    <strong>8.Construction</strong>
    <ul>
      <li class="leading-9">Site prep: Grading, utility hookups, foundation work.</li>
      <li class="leading-9">Build: Framing, enclosure, interior finishes, and landscaping.</li>
      <li class="leading-9">Inspections: City checks for code compliance at each stage.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>9.Finalization</strong>
    <ul>
      <li class="leading-9">Landscaping: Complete privacy plantings, pathways, and outdoor space.</li>
      <li class="leading-9">Occupancy permit: Approved before move-in or rental.</li>
